First, we’re grateful for the support of the [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/){:target="_blank"}, which provided for the staff time and expenses necessary to develop and complete this project.

Additionally, the Community Building section of this project was deeply informed by participation in the [Mozilla Open Leaders Fellowship](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/){:target="_blank"} in Fall 2017. Many thanks to the organizers of that program, including Abigail Cabunoc Mayes of Mozilla, and to Daniela Saderi, neuroscience PhD candidate at Oregon Health & Science University, who served as the mentor to Sprout staff for the duration of the fellowship. This project was critically informed by Sprout’s participation as an exhibitor and presenter in the Open Innovation Zone at Mozilla Festival in October 2017. Many thanks to all who offered feedback and insight on the work of community building and the characteristics of great community builders around the world.

Thanks to Joaquin Gonzalez, the journalist who conducted interviews with our "Voices from the Field" and who wrote these profiles in collaboration with each interview subject. And thanks to Lizzy Nolin, the graphic designer and former Sprout staffer who developed the images and downloadable campaign building tools for the Community Building section of the guide.

The website that displays the Field Guide content is built on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"} framework and borrows heavily from the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}-based documentation system the [twbs team](https://github.com/twbs/){:target="_blank"} used for [their own documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/){:target="_blank"}.

Finally, many thanks to the staff of The Sprout Fund, past and present, who helped develop our organization’s catalytic funding, community building, and storytelling practices. The artifacts included throughout this guide represent the hard work, critical eyes, and thoughtful insights of two decades of Sprouters. Thank you for your expertise, your empathy, and thank you for making so many, many nametags.
