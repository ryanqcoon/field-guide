- technique: "Co-Creation Session"
  tagline: "Lead a hands-on working session and build something new together."
  description: "A broad way to describe a hands-on, in-person session where participants learn something new together. As you plan a co-creation session, consider a mix of large-group and small-group instruction. We find that it's helpful to have an emcee describe a process from the stage and keep time from the front of the room and also have table-based facilitators who can help guide a process and offer help along the way. If possible, offer time at the end of the session to report out on each group's progress. This can feel time consuming, but it can feel rewarding for participants to have something to show and share as a result of their collaborative work."

Develop a chart that invites people to consider big-picture categories and come up with ideas that address a particular concern for a particular audience. Just make sure your categories are straightforward enough to spark your participants' creativity, not stump them. One good idea is to label the columns by people (like program staff, executive staff, and community members) and label the rows with important elements of a program (like sustainability, accessibility, and relevance); then, invite people to come up with ideas that populate the cells where these people and elements intersect."

In advance, organizers should choose a variety of themes—such as sectors, hobbies, ice cream flavors, etc.—and identify four options within each theme—like nonprofit, corporate, government, philanthropy or chocolate, vanilla, blueberry, rocky road. Then, a facilitator should introduce the exercise by asking people to move to the corner of the room that best represents them and their interests. This happens in rounds, start with sectors, then do hobbies, then do ice cream flavors, and so on. During each round, participants pair up with someone new and briefly introduce themesless to each other."

It's a good way to keep introductions quick in a large group by helping people limit their remarks. Consider adding a funny question that goes beyond name, organization, and hometown; we've asked people to name their favorite Thanksgiving side dish and their favorite board game. Feel free to make these questions more serious too: in a gathering at the beginning or end of a multi-day event, consider asking what word people heard most at the event, or ask people to volunteer one word to describe how they feel."

Once you've placed items on the grid, divide the grid into quadrants and focus on the two high-impact quadrants: high-impact, low-effort ideas are quick wins that are worth pursuing soon, while high-impact, high-effort ideas are more likely long-term strategic projects."
