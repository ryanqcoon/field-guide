By collecting the basic information and contact details for the people, projects, and organizations that make up Remake Learning community, site visitors can easily see who is participating in the network and contact them directly to learn more about their work.

As such, the directory serves a dual purpose: facilitating connection and collaboration among members of the network and showcasing the network to external audiences. On the directory, site visitors can read short biographies network members, learn how organizations are involved in Remake Learning, and see example projects that have emerged from the network.

In many cases, directory entries include internal links showing how individual directory entries are connected to other network members listed in the directory, as well as external links for site users to learn more and/or contact members directly.

## Best Practices

### Standards for Inclusion

Remake Learning’s directory is valuable because it represents people, projects, and organizations who maintain an active role in Remake Learning. People in the directory attend network events and participate in collaborative efforts, lead innovative learning experiences for children, youth, and families, contribute to the collective knowledge of the network, develop new tools, technologies, and techniques to support learning innovation, provide funding or other forms of support, and/or support Remake Learning in some other way. Additionally, listing on the directory has been one of the few ways a person, project, or organization can definitively display their membership in the network, making presence on the directory carry a certain weight and meaning.

For these reasons, site managers should be thoughtful when reviewing new directory entry submissions before publishing them live to the website. Developing clear definitions of membership, partnership, and affiliation with Remake Learning will be helpful in this regard.

### Style & Tone

Directory entries are not exhaustive or comprehensive encyclopedia articles about each subject, nor are they simple re-statements of fact. Directory entries are meant to be snapshots of people, projects, and organizations that provide just enough information for site visitors to familiarize themselves with the subject of the entry and then choose to follow external links to learn more or contact the subject directly.

Furthermore, effort should be made to write content (or edit submitted content) so that it is “evergreen,” meaning that it does not contain any information that would automatically cause the entry to become out-of-date as time passes.

In recognition of the diverse audiences that visit Remake Learning, including parents and families with children, content shared on the directory should be respectful and appropriate for all ages.

Directory entries should align with the values, interests, and expectations of Remake Learning:

* Relevant to the themes of teaching, learning, and innovation
* Respectful and appropriate for all ages
* Positive and student-centered
* Active in and/or affiliated with efforts to advance learning innovation in the greater Pittsburgh region
* Use proper spelling and grammar, and complete sentences whenever possible

Website editors are encouraged to consult the [Associated Press Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) for guidance on style, tone, usage, and audience appropriate standards.

### Expanding the Directory

In addition to processing external submissions to the directory, site managers often generate new entries on behalf of new Remake Learning participants, long-time members and affiliates who have never added themselves to the directory, and as part of larger efforts to increase the presence of certain audiences, themes, or categories of members represented on the site. For example, in 2015 Sprout created organization entries for more than a dozen edtech companies (as well as people profiles of select employees of those companies, and project profiles of select products created by those companies) as part of a larger effort to better represent the role of ed-tech companies in the network.

Directory entries are also used to provide additional background and context to blog posts, press releases, and other storytelling outputs. As a new post is prepared for publication, site managers should review it for instances where the people, projects, and organizations mentioned in the text can be linked to a directory entry. Where this is not the case, it may be necessary for the site manager to create a new directory entry in order to complete this internal linking. Doing so enriches the knowledgebase utility of the site, benefits the SEO performance of the site, and contributes to the steady and intentional growth of the directory as a representation of the Remake Learning Network.

### Creating Directory Entries

Directory entries should include the identifying information, descriptive text, contact details, and visual media necessary to provide site users with a snapshot understanding of the member and a means to get in touch and/or learn more. This will usually include:

* Name of person, project, or organization
* A 1-sentence summary of the person, project, or organization for easy browsing
* A 1-3 paragraph biography or narrative of the person, project, or organization that describes their work and how it relates to Remake Learning
* External links to websites, social media accounts, and other online references about the subject of the entry
* Contact information to get in touch with the subject of the entry
* Links to other directory entries and/or external sites with which the subject entry is affiliated

In addition to this information, a feature image is required for all directory entries.  Acceptable image choices include a landscape-oriented headshot portrait photograph of the person, the logo of the project or organization, or a photo of the project in action. Avoid including images that use an excessive amount of text or small text that will be unreadable at small sizes and on mobile devices.

Remake Learning’s directory allows members of the public to submit people, projects, and organizations to add to the directory. While many valuable additions to the directory come in through this form, this does not mean that everything submitted is sufficiently relevant to be included. The following are examples of submissions that should not be added to the directory:

* An organization located outside of the greater Pittsburgh region and/or serving a population that is also outside of the greater Pittsburgh region.
* An edtech company that is not an active participant in Remake Learning events, activities, or programs and has not collaborated with network members, but is using the directory as a marketing platform.
* A person from outside of the greater Pittsburgh region who shares an interest in work that Remake Learning is doing, but is not an active participant in the work.

For those directory submissions that _are_ sufficiently relevant, take extra care to edit the content submitted so that it meets the content standards described above. Directory additions submitted through the form are often copied and pasted from other sources, which may use first person pronouns and may assume a level of familiarity the Remake Learning site users do not have. Take care to frame the entries so that site users understand its relevance to their interests and the broader values of Remake Learning.

### Maintaining the Directory
Without regular ongoing maintenance, content in the directory will go out of date and become irrelevant and untrustworthy. Site managers are responsible for keeping existing entries up-to-date and ensuring that new people, projects, and organizations are added on a regular basis.

At a minimum, the entire directory should be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that information is up-to-date and the selection of people, projects, and organizations remains relevant to Remake Learning.

## History & Background

The directory was one of the three central features (alongside the blog and calendar) present in the earliest versions of the Remake Learning website. The directory was created in response to requests by early network members for a centralized location to browse a collection of network members, see how they are connected, and see examples of their work. Since launching the directory in 2012, The Sprout Fund has added more than 450 people, more than 210 projects, and more than 290 organizations to the directory.

In developing earlier iterations of the directory, Sprout anticipated using it as a database for managing network information, but that proved infeasible as the quantity and complexity of information grew along with the network. The WordPress system upon which the directory was built proved to be a powerful content management system (CMS), but an inadequate Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool. Furthermore, previous iterations of the directory have included filters to allow users to browse the directory by person type, organization time, and focus area. This filtering functionality will return in the next iteration of the directory currently under development.

Sprout has continuously simplified the frontend presentation and backend content management requirements to enhance and make more efficient the use of the directory for showcasing the network to internal and external audiences.

Through regular weekly maintenance, including the processing of submissions from the public, the directory has been consistently grown and made the maintenance of content challenging. The next iteration of the directory currently under development is being built with enhanced site management features to allow for the simpler review and correction of directory entries.

Directory entries are used as source material and collateral content in many other regular communications activities, including blog posts, press releases, and publications.
