On social media, Remake Learning uses shared hashtags, engages directly with network members and national influencers, contributes to conversations, rallies around special opportunities, participates in scheduled social media chats, joins the social media backchannel happening at local and national events, and showcases the work of individual members as well as the network as a whole.

## Best Practices

### Style & Tone

Social media is public and permanent (even if content is deleted later, screenshots and other evidence can remain in the public sphere). The content shared on Remake Learning’s social media accounts represent the Network leadership and, more broadly, the people and organizations of the Network. Maintain a professional tone, and be especially careful when posting about potentially provocative issues.

In recognition of the diverse audiences that follow and trust Remake Learning—including parents, families, and children—content shared on social media should be respectful and appropriate for all ages.

* Write posts and share content that align with the values, interests, and expectations of the Remake Learning Network:
* Relevant to the themes of teaching, learning, and innovation
* Respectful and appropriate to all ages
* Positive and student-centered
* Informed by historical inequities and social constructs that have caused and continue to cause profound disparities and challenges
* Truthful and verifiable
* Use proper spelling and grammar, and complete sentences whenever possible

Share, like, and comment on content that is relevant to Remake Learning’s values and initiatives:

* Network members sharing pictures or stories from their classrooms and learning spaces or Remake Learning events
* Partners and Network members sharing their events, initiatives, and professional development opportunities
* Relevant articles, resources, and opportunities shared by Network members, partners, influencers, researchers, and other community members
* Inspiring/insightful reflections from Network leaders and members
* Posts that mention Remake Learning, when appropriate

Consider ignoring, hiding, and/or blocking content and users that are inappropriate or offensive:

* Angry or critical responses to shared content
* Attacks or other attempts to solicit a reaction
* Irrelevant comments and replies

Social media managers should exercise great caution when considering whether to engage with hostile accounts on social media. In other words: “Don’t feed the trolls.”

_Pro tip: Content should be customized for each social media platform used. For instance, automating the same content on Twitter and Facebook will result in significantly reduced interaction and is a lost opportunity for engagement and effective messaging._

### Gathering Content

Content appropriate for sharing on social media can be gathered from a variety of sources. For a full list of content sources for social media posts, see the Social Media Content Sources document.

Maintain a checklist of sources and hashtags to check regularly, and use it to collect specific links there that you come across throughout the day that you’d like to share. For a template social media calendar and tweet writing tool, see the Social Media Calendar & Tweet Template document.

Finding and selecting content for social media works best when it is informed by the other communications activities described in these stewardship transition deliverables. For more detail about how social media connects with other communications activity, please see the diagram created to illustrate the connections between services.

### Scheduling Posts

Use scheduling tools, like Hootsuite and Facebook’s scheduling tool, to allow daily social media engagement and activity without logging on seven days a week. Complement these pre-composed messages with more responsive, “of the moment” messages throughout the week. Consider developing an editorial schedule that encourages a consistent heartbeat of activity.

### Twitter
_For a basic introduction to using this tool, see Twitter’s [Getting started with Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/215585) support article._

Consider the following Twitter activities to engage @remakelearning’s audience, build followers, and encourage an active conversation:

* Retweet tweets that showcase Network activities and/or contain relevant content
* For tweets that showcase Network activities and/or contain relevant content but need additional context or would benefit from further detail, use the quote tweet function
* Follow relevant hashtags, including #RemakeLearning, #STEM, #EdTech, #k12, and many more (see TeachThought’s Complete Guide to Twitter Hashtags for Education)
* Like tweets that showcase Network activities and/or contain relevant content; tweets liked by the account will be delivered as “you might like this tweet” content to followers
* Tag people and organizations relevant to the content you share; other Twitter accounts can be tagged in the body of a tweet or in an attached picture
* Regularly check account notifications to be aware of conversations that include you, and help identify tweets from partners and Network members that are candidates for liking, retweeting, and quote tweeting
* When appropriate, reply to direct messages and tweets that contain questions or invite a response
* Participate in Twitter chats hosted by local partners to insert Remake Learning’s perspective into the conversation and spread the word about upcoming events, initiatives, and opportunities
* When videos are shorter than 140 seconds, post them by uploading the video file to Twitter (as opposed to linking to YouTube or Vimeo); users will be able to watch the video without leaving Twitter
* To increase reach and engagement, use Twitter’s ad platform to boost tweets with $5-20 promotions
* Follow Network members, thought leaders, influencers, researchers, and others who share relevant content
* Regularly update header image with attractive, high-resolution images and graphics that look good at many screen sizes

### Facebook
_For a basic introduction to using this tool, see Facebook’s [Manage your Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/managing-facebook-pages) support article._

Consider the following Facebook page activities to engage Remake Learning’s audience, earn more likes, and increase interactions:

* When sharing links, delete the link text from the body text of the post after the preview has appeared; if appropriate, change or edit the image and preview text that appears in the link preview so they accurately represent the linked content
* Tag people and organizations relevant to the content you share in the body text of each post; tagging other pages gets the attention of other page managers and makes posts more likely to appear in users’ news feeds
* Create photo albums with pictures from recent photo shoots and tag the organizations and people they feature
* Always post videos by uploading the video file to Facebook (as opposed to linking to YouTube or Vimeo); Facebook prioritizes videos uploaded to their platform, and users will be able to watch the video without leaving Facebook
* Comment on, like, and share relevant posts from partner organizations
* Regularly check account notifications to be aware of conversations that include you and stay abreast of any potentially inappropriate comments (especially on boosted posts)
* When appropriate, reply to direct messages, comments, and page posts that contain questions or invite a response
* To increase reach and engagement on important content, use Facebook’s advertising tools to boost posts, videos, and photo albums with $5-20 promotions
* Use Facebook’s Insights tool to track engagement, post effectiveness, likes, and other analytics
* Regularly update cover image with attractive, high-resolution images and graphics that look good at many screen sizes; include links and other relevant details in cover image text descriptions when they promote a specific initiative or event
