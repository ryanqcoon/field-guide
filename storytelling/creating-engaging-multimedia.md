Remake Learning commissions writers, photographers, videographers, and designers to produce original stories and images that capture the network in action, shine a spotlight on network success stories, and amplify the voice of individual network members. By documenting the activities of network members, Remake Learning generates source material for telling compelling stories that lift up network members and position the network as a whole within the broader context of learning innovation. These efforts create a rich archive of examples and evidence of learning remade, and enable Remake Learning to speak with its own “voice” in the national conversation on education.

## Content Strategy

For Remake Learning, the content strategy guiding documentation and storytelling has evolved overtime, however the overall strategic goal has remained consistent since Sprout assumed the network stewardship role: to amplify the voice of Remake Learning and its members in regional and national conversations about education and innovation.

In the most recent period, Sprout’s approach to content strategy focused on selecting a limited set of ideas and topics to focus on over a given period of time, identify subjects (most often people, projects, and organizations in the network) who exemplify local efforts around those ideas and topics, and develop storylines that frame the chosen subjects within the broader context of the idea or topic being explored.

Using an [editorial calendar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3muqD9llCkeH1ic7ewlQHvBHaUvZjkhIDoykXghBd0/edit?usp=sharing) or [messaging framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DFwyHjUaKBP_e8KOurxxdUvm9dvP1WS9LxgS471c9xE/edit?usp=sharing) to plan documentation and storytelling activities allows those responsible for documentation and storytelling to coordinate multiple storylines that develop over time, while also remaining responsive to opportunities for documentation and storytelling that arise.

Finding and selecting subjects for documentation and storytelling works best when it is informed by the other communications activities described in these stewardship transition deliverables. For more detail about how documentation and storytelling connect with other communications activities, please see [the diagram created to illustrate the connections between services](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bthXnKjSxia9Wd-y9WAkfY39I84WbZjGjlZIYXC1Rz8/edit?usp=sharing).

### Audience & Purpose

Media created by Sprout for Remake Learning has most often been targeted at one or both of the following audiences:

The **internal audience** includes Remake Learning network members, partners, and supporters, as well as professionals in the education and/or learning innovation field. For internal audiences, these media create a shared archive of imagery that explores and affirms network members and the youth they serve. Special consideration should be taken when producing media for internal audiences to insure that the material produced is of real value to their professional practice and/or the story that is being told is relevant and relatable enough to their experience to be inspiring.

The **external audience** includes regional and national funders and policymakers, influencers and practitioners in the broader education innovation movement, and local parents, families and caring adults. For external audiences, these media present a coherent narrative about Remake Learning, its members, and our collective impact. Special consideration should be taken when producing media for external audiences, as they are less likely to understand professional terminology or concepts that may be commonplace in a particular field, but not part of the normal public discourse.

In either case, the media products may or may not have an explicit call to action ("CTA") for the audience to respond to. CTAs are not a requirement for every piece of media, but videos should include some information in the closing credits informing viewers of where they can go to learn more about what they’ve just watched.

### Style & Tone

In general, documentation and storytelling content should align with the values, interests, and expectations of the Remake Learning Network:

* Relevant to the themes of teaching, learning, and innovation
* Respectful and appropriate to all ages
* Positive and student-centered
* Informed by historical inequities and social constructs that have caused and continue to cause profound disparities and challenges
* Truthful and verifiable
* Use proper spelling and grammar, and complete sentences whenever possible

**In writing**, Remake Learning stories should be modelled on high-quality magazine writing: clear and concise, but with a personality. The tone is lively and engaging, conveying a sense of the immediacy and activity of projects happening in real time and providing evidence of the subject’s positive impact on people and communities. Written content should confirm to the following style and tone guidelines:

* Told in a narrative manner, rather than straight reportage
* Except for personal reflections, stories are written in the third person
* Allow the qualities of the subject to speak for themselves, as opposed to using praising language
* Connect abstract ideas to the concrete actions and activities of the subject and/or the normal lived experience of the intended audience
* Avoid the suggestion that the subject of the story has solved all the problems, but instead explore what remains unsolved and suggest how the work continues

**In video**, Remake Learning maintains a style that is youthful (but not immature), engaging, inspiring, accessible, and optimistic. Video content should conform to the following style and tone guidelines:

* Interview subjects are properly lit and miked and directed so that they are comfortable and natural
* Language is clear, comprehensible, and compelling to its intended audience
* Live action b-roll footage is shot documentary-style and illustrates the real people and places involved in Remake Learning activities
* Motion graphics and animation are attractive, clean, friendly, and clever
* Background music is contemporary, smart, engaging, and optimistic
* Except in videos promoting or recapping a particular moment in time, content is "evergreen" and the story is supported by durable examples

**In photography**, Remake Learning seeks to capture the process of learning in action, focusing on interaction between and among educators and learners. In addition to this kind of documentary activity coverage, Sprout also commissions portraits of network members for use in the Remake Learning directory, and event photography to cover important network happenings. Photo content should conform to the following style and tone guidelines:

* Focus on capturing authentic moments of interpersonal interaction, especially between young people and adults
* To the extent possible, always depict youth in groups with their peers or caring adults, rather than in isolation
* Avoid staging shots unless absolutely necessary
* Capture plenty of over-the-shoulder and detail shots to use when depictions of youth faces is not possible or desired
* Include shots that set the context for the scene, such as establishing shots of the location of the shoot and wide shots of the subjects in a specific setting

In recognition of the diverse audiences that follow and trust Remake Learning—including parents, families, and children—content produced by and for Remake Learning should be respectful and appropriate for all ages.

## Best Practices

While writing, photography, and video projects all have their own distinct characteristics, the production process can be generally broken down into six phases: Creative Development, Pre-production, Production, Post-production, Distribution, and Archiving. Guidance on each of these phases is detailed below.

### Creative Development

The focus of the creative development phase is turning abstract ideas and/or messaging goals into well-defined and easily understood storylines that can be feasibly produced.

Ideas may arise naturally from the course of network, appear in the ongoing discourse and news cycle around education, be suggested by Remake Learning staff, members, and partners, or they may be related to a new or ongoing initiative of the network. Oftentimes, special projects and initiatives require some form of documentation and storytelling support. In any case, timing is key. It’s critically important to identify the right moment to document *and* the right moment to publish. Some forms of documentation can have a relatively quick turnaround (photos can be processed same-day if necessary) while others may require weeks of post-production work before release (video is the most obvious example here).

Once you have decided on a story to tell, spend some time thinking about the goals of the story, the big ideas you want to explore, the important questions you want to answer, the quotes you want to hear, and the scenes you want to see. It is often necessary to do some background research on the subject(s) of the story to spur your thinking. Personal and organizational web pages, social media accounts, news stories, and other produced media are easily accessible sources of background information. Phone calls, meetings, and site visits require

Once you have identified the people you’d like to feature as the subject of the story, contact them to explain the idea for the story to them and ask if they would be interested in participating. Be prepared to answer their questions about where and when the story would be produced, where and when it would be shared, and what they will be asked to do. This is also a good opportunity to ask your own exploratory questions to further develop your understanding of the subject, or ask if they can share any internal background material, such as strategic plans, grant proposals, working documents, and the like.

To distill the story into a sensible document that a vendor can use to get started, use one of the assignment briefing templates provided in the Sprout asset transfer. These templates include a combination of "checklist" info that is a must have (basic details, contact information, dates and times, etc.) and also prompts to spur more creative thinking about the project.

Whenever appropriate and possible, compare the briefing document you create to a strategic messaging screen such as those created by the [Frameworks Institute](http://frameworksinstitute.org/k-12-education.html) and the [Shared Story Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HnrOpvFJ4Kz64BYKVYKoVs7AfdOXLwBao7Nzhycc3VY/edit?usp=sharing). These tools ask questions that encourage you to review your work through a different lens than you may be accustomed to. They are helpful in identifying potential missteps and "traps" that may cause the project to miss its messaging goals or, worse, backfire when viewed by target audiences.

### Budgeting & Vendor Selection

Once the story has been solidified, the subjects have been secured, and the creative brief has been developed, is creating a project budget and hiring a media vendor (writer, photographer, videographer) to produce the project.

For **writing**, costs for a feature-length story (1,000 - 1,500 words) are typically in the $500 range while simpler assignments like interviews, field reports, and commentary pieces can be priced in the $300 - $400 range.

For **photography**, costs for a single-subject photoshoot by a professional photographer typically range between $250 and $350, however the circumstances of the shoot or the pay range of the vendor may drive that cost higher.

For **video**, costs can vary widely due to the number of variables. Video shoots require a minimum crew of two people and are typically priced in "half-day" or “full day” increments. A half-day two-person shoot ranges from $600 to $750, while a full day two-person shoot ranges from $1,100 to $1,300. Post-production costs (processing footage, editing, color correction, etc.) is typically priced based on an hourly rate and is dependent on the desired outputs of the project. Post-production for a single, web-optimized video with a duration around 3 minutes will likely be scoped at 25 - 35 hours of post-production, which will likely run between $1,500 and $2,500. Additional fees, such as music licensing or the purchase of an external hard drive to transfer footage, can add $100 - $300 to the final budget. So, in total, a single-subject, single-shoot, single-output video should be budgeted between $2,250 and $3,500.

Except for complex projects that may require extra background work, out-of-town travel, or multiple shoots, It’s better to set a budget before engaging a vendor than to have the vendor develop a quote.

When selecting a vendor, consider how their past work fits with the goals of the project. Some vendors specialize their practice, while others who may be generally well-skilled, exhibit their talents best with specific kinds of assignments. For example, some writers come from a magazine or creative nonfiction background and specialize in narrative writing, while others may have a journalism background and are more comfortable conducting field reports or interviews. Photographers may specialize in events, portraits, or documentary style. Videographers often fall on a spectrum of how "produced" their videos are. Videographers on one end of that spectrum will focus on staging shots, feeding lines to subjects, and using intentional lighting as often as possible. On the other end of the spectrum are videographers who take a more observational or documentary approach with only minimal production values.

In any case, a review of a vendor’s website, reel, or work examples will often reveal the mode in which they are most comfortable working.

Refer to the [list of vendors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j0-lA4YCidtmFv7n4Zr-_HdPmrwrp3VVVvXJiTQqMHg/edit?usp=sharing) Sprout frequently engaged for Remake Learning documentation and storytelling for contact information.

### Pre-production

The focus of the pre-production phase is preparing for and coordinating the work of media vendors (writers, photographers, videographers).

This is the time to reconnect with the subjects to confirm their participation, describe in detail what the production experience will be like and what will be asked of them, and confirm time, date, and location details. If youth are going to be depicted, this is also the time to work with the subject or principal point of contact to secure [media appearance consent releases ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jfYdmazlA-SFpkZEVkSDI2MGs/view?usp=sharing)from parents and guardians.

For video shoots, be sure to discuss on-site logistics with subject(s) and/or principal point of contact, including directions, parking, and site access details. Remember that video crews will need to load-in and store their gear on-site. In some cases, it may be necessary to scout the location in advance of the shoot to confirm details yourself.

Once production details are confirmed with the subject(s), send briefing materials to the vendors. In addition to the creative brief prepared during creative development, also share the interview questions that will be asked of subjects. Additional background materials may include existing assets like photos, logos, brand assets, or past video footage. Meet with the vendors to go over the briefing materials and answer any questions they have.

For **writing and photography** assignments, introduce the vendor to the subject(s) and/or principal points of contact by email so they can coordinate directly.

For **videos**, prepare and distribute [crew call sheets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jfYdmazlA-TDZKdUFkd2J3MDQ/view?usp=sharing) in the days leading up to production and send a reminder to the subject and/or principal points of contact confirming last minute details.

### Production

The production phase is where the magic happens.

For **video**, plan to accompany the crew on production. On the day of the shoot, arrive early to confirm location details and establish contact with the subject(s) and/or principal point of contact. Be prepared to assist the video crew as needed, moving things, finding and securing quiet spaces to conduct interviews, carrying equipment, move furniture, and manage crowd control.

For photography, it is often helpful, but not necessary to accompany the photographer to the shoot. For projects with very specific shooting goals, providing on-site direction to the photographer is likely to yield the shots you’re looking for. For projects whose subjects require special handling (VIPs, families, organizational partners, children, etc.), it may be necessary to accompany the photographer in order to answer questions and liaise with the subject.

For **writing**, it is rare that you need to accompany the writer on site-visits or during interviews. Remind the writer that you are available to answer questions or review passages that may arise over the course of the writing process, but before a complete draft is available.

### Post-production

The focus of the post-production phase is refining the work of the media vendors from rough cuts and drafts to finished products ready for release.

Establish clear expectations for the post-production timeline, including specific dates for when rough cuts and drafts are due, dates by which you will provide feedback, dates when refined cuts and drafts are due, and dates by which files must be finalized for release.

If the project requires input from clients, funders, or partners, confirm to a mutually agreeable review process that allows for group feedback while also making orderly progress toward the final product. Keep in mind that vendors base their post-production budgets on a set number of revision rounds and exceeding that number will likely incur additional charges.

When preparing written feedback, be as clear and straightforward as possible. It is often helpful to provide both high-level overall comments to provide general feedback about the piece as a whole, what parts are working and what parts need more attention, and then provide specific scene-by-scene or line-by-line comments as a bulleted punch list for the vendor to resolve. In some cases, it may be necessary to meet with the vendor and sit in on the editing process to point out specific issues and verbalize your feedback in conversation.

For **video projects**, write the names and affiliations for everyone appearing on screen so that the vendor has accurate spellings for creating lower-third titles. Provide text and logos for inclusion in closing credits. Be sure to check all on-screen text for proper spelling and accuracy.

For **photography projects**, request the photographer to provide basic processing, labelling, and tagging of their photos. The photographer should also make an initial selection of photos, rather than submitting the full set of photos captured at the shoot. A photographer may shoot hundreds of images, most of which will be unusable, while 15 - 25 may be suitable for submission. For those submitted photos, ingest them into your filing system and make your own selection of the top 3-5 photos from the shoot.

For **writing projects**, in addition to reviewing for basic spelling, grammar, and usage, read the piece from several points of view. Take on the perspective of different kinds of readers: a reader in the know, a reader coming to the subject for the first time, a skeptic, a funder, a partner, etc. If you make direct edits in-line, be sure to use a change tracking tool so that the vendor knows what has been changed. Share it with subjects for fact-checking after you’re happy with it.

### Distribution

The focus of the distribution phase is sharing the finished media products and supporting readership, viewership, and engagement with the media.

Once a piece is finalized, send to the finished product to everyone involved in the project, including vendors, subjects, and partners. Include an explanation of credit attribution and usage rights. Be sure to also send it to your internal team and explain where and how it will be posted and how they can help with distribution.

For **photo projects**, post the final selects to a Facebook album. Be sure to tag them and add captions, then share the album on twitter and maybe share a selection of the images on Instagram.

For **video projects**, post the final video to Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. When posting to social media, use the platform’s native video player whenever possible. See more about posting videos to social media in the [Social Media Explainer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14t_VRvL4WnhVuHcRvz1EqdFQ8DwFKjLTuuX72L8eRF0/edit?usp=sharing). Be sure to add tags and a description to the file, linking back to wherever the media is featured. Thank (and mention, if appropriate) the vendors, subjects, and partners. Add caption files using YouTube’s built in captioning tool. If the video is supported by a writing project, publish it on the Remake Learning blog.

For **writing projects**, prepare the final written piece for publication via the Remake Learning blog. Be sure to include visual support, such as a featured cover image, body images or graphics, or a related video. Draft social media messages previewing the new post and schedule multiple messages to share out over several days.

### Archiving

The focus of the archiving phase is managing the orderly storage and future use of media files.

For **photography projects**, find a software solution that is specifically designed to handle photo files. Use a date-based filing system to keep your photos organized chronologically. Add tags and keywords to photos so that you can use full text search to call up photos for easy retrieval. For final selects, store a copy of the files in a web-accessible space such as [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) so that colleagues, partners, subjects, and others can find and access the photos as needed. A workable solution is better than a perfect solution. You spent a lot of money on photos, people should be able to use them.

For **video projects**, have the video vendor save the final video output together with all source footage and project files on an external hard drive. If you work regularly with the same video vendor who can store footage for you, develop a straightforward method for keeping track of the files they maintain. Be sure to get backup copies of the files and consider moving old footage to deep cloud storage. Hard drives decay, so if there is some footage that is really useful, make sure you back it up.

## History & Background

The Sprout Fund began producing original media about learning innovation in 2009 when the Spark program was first launched. These early efforts were greatly expanded when Sprout assumed the role of network steward in late 2011 and early 2012, at which time Sprout began working closely with a core cadre of writers, photographers, and videographers to develop a consistent look and feel for Remake Learning stories.

Over the period of its stewardship, Sprout maintained the following ongoing storytelling and documentation activities:

* **Blog posts** relate local stories to big ideas with resonance beyond our region, profile people, projects, and organizations active in the network, share stories and reports from the field, and amplify local voices. Since 2012, Sprout published more than 750 blog posts to remakelearning.org and its predecessor website, averaging approximately 10 posts per month.   

* **Photography** provides coverage of ongoing activities, creates visual support for other messages, and builds an archive of imagery for all network members to use. Since 2009, Sprout has commissioned more than 520 photoshoots of people, projects, and events, averaging 4-5 photo shoots per month.

* **Videos** create compelling visual stories that explore single-subject topics, profile important programs, initiatives, and campaigns, explain big ideas, and promote important events and opportunities. Since 2009, Sprout produced 76 videos about learning innovation, averaging approximately 8 videos per year.

The content strategy used for each of these forms of documentation and storytelling is detailed below.

In addition to these ongoing activities, Sprout has also produced special publications about the Remake Learning Network:

* [The Kids + Creativity Briefing Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1jfYdmazlA-X292Q3Q5UHFJN0k?usp=sharing) was produced in 2012 and consisted of a branded folder containing briefing documents introducing the Kids + Creativity Network, its mission, structure and operation, and focus areas. Sprout wrote the content and worked with designer Terri Wolfe to create the materials. While text-heavy and less visual than future materials, this kit proved flexible and adaptable enough to keep it in circulation through 2015.

* [The Remake Learning magazine insert](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1jfYdmazlA-YkV6aVJ0Vk0xQTQ?usp=sharing) (also known as "the purple") was produced in 2013 and updated in 2015. The publication was originally produced as an 8-page special advertising section in Pittsburgh Magazine, introducing readers to Remake Learning and highlighting several exemplary people, projects, and organizations active in the network. It also featured a list of resources for educators, youth, and families. Sprout wrote the content and again worked with designer Terri Wolfe to create the piece, leveraging original Remake Learning photography by Ben Filio.

* [The Remake Learning Playbook](http://remakelearning.org/playbook/) was produced in 2015 as a book-length publication detailing the origin, development, and operation of the Remake Learning network. Intended as a field guide to help other communities interested in setting up their own collaborative innovation networks, the Playbook combined storytelling with instructional content based on Sprout’s experience building the network support infrastructure for Remake Learning. Sprout worked closely with a team of writers, photographers, videographers, and audio producers to generate the content for the Playbook’s print and digital versions. Little Kelpie designed the print publication.

* [Learning Together ](http://downloads.sproutfund.org/remakelearning/Learning-Together_digital.pdf)was produced in 2017 as a 10-year retrospective of Remake Learning’s impact in its first decade. The publication shares examples of learning remade and tallies up what the network and its members have accomplished since 2007. Sprout wrote the content and again worked with Little Kelpie to design the publication, leveraging original Remake Learning photography by Ben Filio and others.

While each of these publications is distinct in its concept, intent, content, and design, they all share a common origin from within the universe of written and visual content created by Sprout for Remake Learning. Each of these publications relied heavily on the ongoing work to document the network in action and translate what was captured into relatable stories.
