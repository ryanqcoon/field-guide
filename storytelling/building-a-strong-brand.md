The brand logo, colors, font, and style permeates everything created by Remake Learning and indicates that material on which it appears represents the vision and values of Remake Learning. Furthermore, the brand is used by members, partners, and other affiliates to signify their participation in and support of Remake Learning.

With consistent usage by Remake Learning, its members, partners, and supporters, the brand helps to build awareness of, understanding of, and trust in Remake Learning among its target audiences, including the general public.

## Basic Usage

Be consistent in the use of the brand, but avoid being rigid. The brand should be present in everything made by, for, and about Remake Learning, but different uses will call for different applications of the brand elements. For example, you can use the brand font and colors to create video titles and documents that are clearly part of the Remake Learning family, without forcing the inclusion of the logo where it does not belong.

When using the brand, use it in full. Avoid manipulating the logo in way that causes it to become unrecognizable or appear like a parody of itself.

Be sure that the brand image is large enough to be clearly recognizable as the Remake Learning brand. If the space available is too small to use the primary or secondary logo that includes the Remake Learning wordmark, use the square or petals-only versions.

Be sure to provide enough space around the logo so that it can “breathe.” The logo should not come into contact with another branded image or design element and the space around the logo should be in visual balance with the rest of the piece.

In a design that features other branded images or design elements, use the version of the logo that works best for that particular placement. For example, if the logo is appearing alongside other logos that are uniformly square, use the square version of the Remake Learning logo.

When placing the logo against background that isn’t white, be sure to use a version of the logo with a transparent background.

Be especially thoughtful when placing the logo on a photograph. Try to place the logo in an area of the image where the color variation is low. If necessary, apply an opacity screen or color wash to the photo before placing the logo.

If the logo is being used on material that will be printed or otherwise rendered in black and white, or it has a background not conducive to a multi-color logo, use the grayscale or single-color version of the Remake Learning logo.

In digital applications, such as a website logo placement or email, link the image directly to http://remakelearning.org so that by clicking on the logo image, the user is taken to the Remake Learning website. If this is not possible, make sure the link is written in close proximity to the logo.

Use the highest quality, highest-resolution version of the logo possible. Where appropriate, use the vector file version of the logo to preserve quality.
If the brand font is used as text, such as in a document or presentation slideshow, be sure to confirm that the text renders as desired. It may be necessary to “flatten” the item (i.e. convert the document into a PDF, save the presentation slides as images) to ensure that the fonts appear correctly.

If in doubt, refer to the brand guidelines.

## Brand Extensions

Continuously develop extensions in response to emergent themes, special events, strategic priorities, or milestones.

Base all extensions on the master brand guidelines established for Remake Learning.

If working with a designer, request that they provide working or “mechanical” files of all finished designs along with the final rendered images.
Use caution when deviating from the established color scheme. All new colors should be derived from colors specified in master brand guidelines.

Do not combine the Remake Learning logo with another recognizable brand logo or wordmark. Instead, task a designer with developing a brand extension that maintains Remake Learning’s brand identity.

Establish clear review protocols and designate someone to approve extensions.

Save working and finished files in a consolidated design archive for future reference and use.

## Material Creation

Ask vendor to provide design specifications and use them to select and adapt the Remake Learning logo for each particular use. It is highly unlikely that the the standard logo files will be able to be used without modification.

At a minimum, branded material should Include the five-petal logomark and remakelearning.org URL.

Be sure to use the correct color model to use: RGB for digital materials, CMYK for printed materials. If in doubt, confirm with the vendor.

In cases where the vendor will be unable to match colors exactly to those specified in the brand guidelines, ask the vendor what color system they are using (e.g., Pantone) and use reference materials to find the closest match.

Always ask for a proof. Physical proofs are preferred to digital proofs.

Some material products, like merchandise or “swag,” will likely reproduce a lower quality image than what is provided. To avoid detrimental loss of quality, be sure the vendor is using the highest-resolution version of the logo.

Establish clear review protocols and designate someone to approve branded materials.

Save working and finished files in a consolidated design archive for future reference and use.

## Third-Party Usage

Coordinate with third-parties to learn as much as possible about the intended use of the Remake Learning brand and identity including where it will appear, who will see it, when it will start and stop being used, how it will be placed, if it will be modified, and to what purpose the brand will be used.

At a minimum, provide all third-parties with brand guidelines to govern their use of the brand. If necessary, enter into a written agreement with the third-party user.

Request to see, review, and approve any use of the Remake Learning brand before it is made public or goes to to print.

If the use of the brand is not to satisfaction, offer to help the third-party user improve the use of the logo. This may require making design modifications directly or providing alternate versions of brand elements.

If an unauthorized third-party use of the logo is found, contact the third-party user to establish communication and work with them to clarify if and how the usage should continue.

Establish clear review protocols and designate someone to approve third-party uses.
