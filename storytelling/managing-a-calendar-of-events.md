As the most popular page on Remake Learning’s website, the calendar is one of the services that Network members use most. On the calendar, Network members can find ways to improve their teaching practice, opportunities to connect with other innovators, and grants to help them try something new.

The calendar also serves as a showcase of the innovative professional development and community involvement in the Pittsburgh region, and a way for Network members to promote their events and activities to the wider community of practice.  

## Best Practices

### Basic Usage

Remake Learning’s calendar is relevant to the site audience because of its explicit focus on events and opportunities for education professionals. Teachers, administrators, out-of-school educators, researchers, edtech professionals, and parents go to the calendar to find ways to improve their practice, stay informed of the innovations happening locally and nationally, and get engaged with their professional community.

For this reason, events and opportunities for children, youth, and families should not be added to the calendar unless they are particularly relevant to or valuable for Remake Learning’s audience. Events and opportunities for children, youth, and families should be redirected to the Kidsburgh calendar and, when appropriate, to the Remake Learning Days calendar. The following are examples of exceptions to this general rule:

* A youth-facing component of a larger Remake Learning initiative
* A particularly relevant event hosted by a key Remake Learning organization
* An opportunity that showcases the innovative educational opportunities that result from the Remake Learning effort

### Style & Tone

The events and opportunities on Remake Learning’s calendar represent the Network leadership and, more broadly, the people and organizations of the Network.

It is sometimes the perception of site users that Remake Learning is the host organization of events listed on the calendar. While this isn’t the case, and an effort should be made to use framing language in each event post that makes the host organization clear, this misperception underlines the necessity of maintaining a professional tone in all calendar content.

In recognition of the diverse audiences that follow and trust Remake Learning, including parents and families with children, content shared on the calendar should be respectful and appropriate for all ages.

Calendar entries should align with the values, interests, and expectations of Remake Learning:

* Relevant to the themes of teaching, learning, and innovation (see below for a list of archetypal items)
* Respectful and appropriate for all ages
* Positive and student-centered
* Open to the public, or at least to a fair proportion of Network members
* Restate the host organization and use third-person plural pronouns to clarify that the host organization is not Remake Learning (except in posts for which Remake Learning is the host)
* Use proper spelling and grammar, and complete sentences whenever possible

Website editors are encouraged to consult the [Associated Press Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) for guidance on style, tone, usage, and audience appropriate standards.

### Gathering Content

Events and opportunities appropriate for the calendar can be gathered from a variety of sources. For a full list of content sources for the calendar, see the Calendar Content Sources Subscriptions and Websites documents.

Maintain a checklist of sources to check regularly, and use it to collect specific links that you come across throughout the day that you’d like to share.

Finding and selecting content for the calendar works best when it is informed by the other communications activities described in these stewardship transition deliverables. Please see the Remake Learning Communications diagram that illustrates how the calendar is dependent on other communications activities.

### Creating Calendar Entries

Calendar entries should include all of the information a site user would need to register for and/or attend an event or take advantage of an opportunity. This will usually include:

* Event or opportunity name (year should be included here if annual)
* Event location
* Event time and date or opportunity date range/deadline
* A short description of the event or opportunity, including schedule and eligibility requirements
* Cost information, including if an event is free
* Registration requirements and a link to register, if applicable
* Where on the web to find more information
* Event or opportunity host, partners, and funders
* Contact information for event or opportunity, if applicable
* The hashtag and/or social media accounts associated with the event or opportunity

In addition to this information, a feature image is required for all calendar entries. Acceptable image choices include the event logo, an image of past similar events, or the logo of the host organization. Avoid including images that use an excessive amount of text or small text that will be unreadable at small sizes and on mobile devices.

Remake Learning’s calendar allows members of the public to submit their events to the calendar. While many valuable additions to the calendar come in through this form, this does not mean that everything submitted is sufficiently relevant to be included. The following are examples of events and opportunities that should not be added to the calendar:

* A local workshop or conference without a connection to Remake Learning
* A screening of The Great Gilly Hopkins
* An ongoing engagement campaign without clear start and end dates
* An education grant opportunity eligible only to people and organizations in Ohio
* A personal party for a Network member
* A conference that isn’t relevant to Remake Learning’s themes and values
* A small innovative learning event happening in another city/region

For those event submissions that are sufficiently relevant, take extra care to edit the content submitted so that it meets the content standards described above. Events and opportunities submitted through the form are often copied and pasted from the host organization’s internal description of the event, which may use first person pronouns and may assume a level of familiarity the Remake Learning site users do not have. Take care to frame the event so that site users understand its relevance to their interests and the broader values of Remake Learning.

## Event Archetypes

### Workshops & Professional Development

Workshops and professional development opportunities are the most common type of event posted to the calendar. The calendar includes all of the workshops hosted by the Allegheny Intermediate Unit’s Center for Creativity, as well as the summer professional development intensives hosted by Network organizations each year, and dozens of other workshops, classes, bootcamps, and sessions hosted in the Pittsburgh region to help educators level up, share knowledge, and learn new things.

The following are key details to include when posting a workshop or professional development opportunity:

* Whether or not Act 48 credits are available for this workshop
* The cost, including any discounts available
* The target audience for the workshop
* Any prerequisite knowledge or skills needed for the workshop to be valuable, or if the workshop doesn’t require prior knowledge or skills
* The specific skills that will be covered and examples of classroom applications
* The deadline to register

### Grant Opportunities

Grant opportunities are another popular form of calendar content. Grant opportunities vary from $1,000 micro-grants for individual classrooms to six-figure support for campaigns at a district or regional level. Grant opportunities may take the form of competitions, requests for proposals, or more traditional calls for applications. When posted on the Remake Learning calendar, grant opportunities help Network members connect to funding for their projects large and small.

The following are key details to include when posting a grant opportunity:

* Description of the opportunity, including amount of available funding
* Eligibility requirements
* Deadline and timeline for participation
* Details and links to any upcoming webinars, conference calls, or other applicant support services
* Key decision-making considerations and criteria
* Links to the opportunity and application materials

### Tentpole Network Events

Remake Learning’s regular network-wide events are an opportunity for the whole community to come together, and members expect to find these events on the calendar. Consider creating a “Save the Date” post if a date is chosen before details have been released, so that Network members can mark their calendars.

The following are key details to include when posting a tentpole network event:

* The venue
* The theme or focus of the event
* Which Network member people, projects, and organizations will be featured
* Any special activities or moments to expect
* What kind of food and refreshments will be served
* A registration link

### Conferences & National Convenings

Conferences and national convenings are important opportunities for Network members to showcase their work and find out what’s happening in learning innovation across the country and the world. In particular ed tech conferences offer Network member an opportunity to get to know the latest ways to enhance their teaching with technology. But there are also conferences and convenings available for Network members in nearly every imaginable interest or focus area, and posting them to the calendar helps Network members find one that matches their needs.

The following are key details to include when posting a conference or national convening:

* Focus and target audience for the conference or convening
* Short historical account of the conference, including past Remake Learning involvement
* Information about Network members who are already registered or have sessions
* Cost and accommodation information
* Special sessions, pre-conference days, and distinctive details
* Keynote speaker(s) and other special opportunities
* The hashtag and/or social media accounts associated with the event or opportunity

### Calls for Collaboration or Participation

Regional and national calls for collaboration are regular features of the calendar. These can range from Network member organizations seeking survey responses to national organizations’ calls for commitments to education initiatives to conferences seeking interesting and substantive speakers and sessions. Posting these opportunities to calendar encourages collaboration and helps Network members participate in education innovation on the national stage.

The following are key details to include when posting a call for collaboration or participation:

* Description of the call and its purpose
* Eligibility requirements
* Deadline and timeline for participation
* Compensation or benefits available to participants
* Description of desired outcomes
* Names of Network members who are already involved

### Online Events

As work moves onto the internet, so does collaboration. Organizations large and small are hosting participatory events online, from Twitter chats to webinars. Adding these to the calendar helps Network members find ways to participate in a community of practice without leaving their desks (or even, perhaps, their couches).

The following are key details to include when posting an online event:

* A short context for what the communication medium is, for those unfamiliar
* A description of the value and desired outcome of the event
* Instructions for registering and participating
* A link to where the event will place

### Job Opportunities

Job postings help Network organizations find highly qualified candidates and Network individuals grow professionally. Job postings are popular newsletter content and showcase the growing opportunity to remake learning in the region.

The following are key details to include when posting a job opportunity:

* Whether the position is fulltime or part time
* Whether the position is salaried or hourly and, if available, the pay rate
* The job description and desired qualifications
* Application instructions
* A short framing of the hiring organization’s role in Remake Learning

### Activities for Children

As stated above, activities for children should be limited to particular cases. In those select cases, this content can be a powerful showcase of efforts of the Remake Learning Network and create opportunities for Network organizations to reach a more diverse audience of young people.

The following are key details to include when posting an activity for children:

* A short framing of how this event fits into the regional effort to Remake Learning
* How an educator should share this with their students and/or students’ parents
* The age group this event is appropriate for
* Whether or not this is a drop-in activity
* Whether or not children can be left unattended at this activity
* Whether or not there will be food and refreshments at this activity
* The cost of this activity
* Whether this is a one-time event or a program or series

## History & Background

Since launching the calendar in 2012 The Sprout Fund has added more than 2,400 events and opportunities, an average of 10 listings per week. The calendar has come to be a trusted source for events and opportunities of interest to the Remake Learning Network, and event posts are often at the top of search engine results for opportunities and grants.

While the calendar has always made it a priority to feature events for educators and other practitioner members of the Remake Learning community, Sprout made prior efforts to maintain distinct audience segmentation on the Remake Learning calendar. From 2012 through 2015, Sprout also posted events and opportunities for children and families and teen audiences.

To help site users distinguish among content on the calendar, Sprout implemented a simple filtering system that allowed the calendar to be viewed from three perspectives: Events and Opportunities for Educators and Innovators; Events and Opportunities for Children and Families; and Events and Opportunities for Youth and Teens.

However, it was determined that these efforts duplicated those made by individual youth- and family-serving organizations, as well as the Kidsburgh calendar, which focused entirely on children and family events and opportunities and attracted a far greater share of the parent and family audience than Remake Learning. Given these insights, and recognizing that the calendar was filling a niche for learning innovation practitioners, Sprout has focused the calendar contents entirely on the needs and interests of this audience.

Through regular weekly maintenance, including the processing of submissions from the public, the calendar has been consistently kept up-to-date. Calendar entries are used as collateral in many other regular communications activities, including social media and newsletters.
