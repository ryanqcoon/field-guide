Sent on alternating Fridays, the Remake Learning newsletter shares a mix of information to draw attention to important items, share stories and resources, and promote events and opportunities. Sent every Tuesday, the Remake Learning e-blast is a single-subject message that attracts subscribers’ attention to particularly important news or information, alerts them to timely events and opportunities, and makes specific calls to action.

Additionally, the Remake Learning email subscription list is one of the most comprehensive lists of network contacts that Remake Learning possesses.

## Best Practices

### Audience & Purpose

Remake Learning’s email marketing is valuable to its subscribers because it speaks to their interests in learning innovation as it relates to their day-to-day lives as educators, mentors, youth-workers, researchers, technologists, entrepreneurs, employers, funders, and community stakeholders. In short, Remake Learning email marketing shares information and calls to action that are relevant to professionals in the learning innovation space.

Focusing on this intended audiences and maintaining a clear purpose and expected use of email marketing is essential to building steady subscription growth and maintaining engagement levels.

While Sprout has done some grouping and segmenting of the general subscription list to allow for more targeted distributions (and therefore create space for more wide-ranging messages), more work should be done to appropriately group and segment the entire subscription list before starting to distribute new kinds of messages to the list.

### Style & Tone

Remake Learning newsletters and e-blasts are intended to be read quickly disposed of after they are consumed and/or action has been taken. Written content in email marketing messages should be short and to the point, with just enough character and personality to excite readers about the content and encourage them to take action on it.

While the newsletter is used to narrative content, it is not intended to reproduce stories in their entirety and subscribers are not expecting to read full texts in their email client. For example, when sharing a blog post in a Remake Learning newsletter, include only a short excerpt of the full post and then include a statement like “Read the whole story on remakelearning.org” and link that statement to the appropriate blog post.

Calls to action are particularly important to email marketing messages, especially e-blasts where the entire purpose of the message is to ask subscribers to take a specific action, like registering for an event or applying for a grant. Whenever possible, use short and clear imperative statements written in the second person to indicate the calls to action.

Email content should align with the values, interests, and expectations of Remake Learning:

* Relevant to the themes of teaching, learning, and innovation
* Relevant to and aware of efforts to advance learning innovation in the greater Pittsburgh region
* Respectful and appropriate for all ages
* Use proper spelling and grammar, and complete sentences

In recognition of the diverse audiences that receive Remake Learning, including parents and families with children, email content should be respectful and appropriate for all ages. Email authors are encouraged to consult the [Associated Press Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) for guidance on style, tone, usage, and audience appropriate standards.

### Gathering Content

The Remake Learning newsletter includes four distinct sections, each focusing on a specific kind of content:

* The **Featured Item** is the top-most piece of content in the newsletter and is the item subscribers see first when they open the message. Content for this section is typically an important Remake Learning blog post from the previous two weeks or an important call to action.
* The **Learning Innovation News** section includes 6-8 items for subscribers to read, such as education news stories, research reports relevant to teaching and learning, blog posts and opinion pieces by thought leaders, or other info that subscribers need to know. Content appropriate for this section can be gathered from a variety of sources, including the websites listed in the Email Newsletter Content Sources document.
* The **Featured Opportunity** callout focuses on an important event or opportunity that is coming up soon. Content for the featured opportunity typically comes from the Remake Learning calendar and is selected for its high level of priority relative to other calendar entries.
* The **Upcoming Events & Opportunities** section lists events, conferences, workshops, grants, job openings, and other deadline-driven items occurring in the next 6 weeks according to the Remake Learning calendar.

As Remake Learning e-blasts focus on just one item at a time, the most common source for content is the Remake Learning calendar, in particular the tentpole network events that occur throughout the year.

Finding and selecting content for newsletters and e-blasts works best when it is informed by the other communications activities described in these stewardship transition deliverables. Please see the Remake Learning Communications diagram that illustrates how email marketing is dependent on other communications activities.

### Composing Messages

_NOTE: The Remake Learning Newsletter has previously been prepared using MailChimp. For specific technical instruction on using the MailChimp interface, refer to their [Getting Started with MailChimp user guide](https://mailchimp.com/resources/guides/getting-started-with-mailchimp/)._

Sprout established templates for both newsletters and e-blasts to make composing messages and reusing content easier. Messages should deviate from these established templates only occasionally as a way to indicate to subscribers that the message they are receiving is out of the ordinary.

When using images, it’s important to be mindful of their dimensions and file size. MailChimp has helpful built in warnings that indicate images that are too large. It’s better to reduce the size of an image that is too big than it is to expand an image that is too small. Plus, MailChimp's native image editor can be used to quickly to adjust images. Finally, keep in mind that images may not display for all subscribers, so avoid including any essential information in the images themselves.

### Sending Messages

Before sending an email to the subscriber list, first send a test message to internal staff. Review the message in a variety of email programs (e.g. Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail) and devices (e.g. desktop computer, tablet, phone) to ensure that the message displays as desired. It may be necessary to revise the size and formatting of text, reduce the quantity of text or images, or make other changes in order to achieve the desired look.

Additionally, it’s important to check all of the links in the message to ensure that they take the subscriber to the desired web destination. As email campaigns are frequently replicated and remixed for other purposes, some links from previous mailings may be left behind. This is also a good time to review the message for spelling and grammar errors, something that may require copying the message content and pasting it into Microsoft Word or a similar program that has robust built-in review tools.

Finally, if the email is being sent on behalf of a specific network member or partner, be sure to send them a test message as well so they can review it and confirm that it represents them accurately.

Once an email has been reviewed and approved, use MailChimp's native scheduling tool to determine the best time to send it. Each email generates a unique URL that can be used just like any other website address. Use the email URL to share the message on Remake Learning’s social media channels and/or post it to RemakeLearning.org.
When appropriate, consider forwarding the email to individual contacts along with a personal message drawing their attention to email content that is of particular interest to them.

## History & Background

The Sprout Fund began sending the mass emails that would evolve into Remake Learning newsletters and e-blasts in 2012 when it assumed the stewardship role for what was then called the Pittsburgh Kids+Creativity Network. Sprout used an email marketing service to send these messages which has since been deactivated, so historical information about these messages is not readily available.

Sprout began using Mailchimp, the current email marketing vendor for Remake Learning, in March 2014 with an initial list of approximately 2,200 subscribers gathered in the preceding two years. Since then, the subscriber list has grown to more than 5,500 subscribers. Remake Learning email marketing messages have an average open rate of 19.4% and an average click rate of 2.1%, equating to approximately 1,100 opens and 115 clicks on any given message. These rates are in line with nonprofit industry averages.

The Remake Learning newsletter is sent on alternating Fridays mornings and includes a featured item (usually a recent blog post), a collection of 6-8 resources or stories, a featured event, and a list of all Remake Learning calendar events and opportunities for the next 6 weeks. Prior to 2015, Sprout sent the newsletter on a weekly basis, but reduced this frequency based on feedback garnered through the annual network survey.

The Remake Learning e-blast is usually sent on Tuesday mornings, however it has also been sent on Mondays and Wednesdays as necessary to accommodate information gathering. It is not sent on Thursdays in order to avoid messaging subscribers two days in a row on weeks when the Remake Learning newsletter will be sent. The weekly e-blast was introduced in 2014 in an effort to standardize the timing, content, and frequency, of event-specific messages.

In total, Sprout has distributed 263 messages to the Remake Learning subscribers list since March 2014, amounting to an average of 6-7 email messages sent per month.
