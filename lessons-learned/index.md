<div class="alert alert-info">contains Philosophy & Ideals + CBFG LL; need to also add Op-Ed content</div>

The Sprout Fund pioneered a new mechanism for community-driven, community-advised philanthropy. Working out of neighborhood storefronts, we were open and accessible to anyone with an idea. Our investments amplified diverse voices and created space in Pittsburgh for new approaches. We built strong networks to help ideas take hold. From 2001 to 2018, we showed that even the small-scale stuff can yield big results.

## Ideals

Our approach to community change was born of its time and place but, over 17 years, it evolved. It was durable, flexible, and adaptable  because a distinct set of beliefs guided our work:

-   **Responsive**: We amplified community voices and listened to local needs.

-   **Inclusive**: We welcomed diverse perspectives. We opened doors for new audiences by reducing barriers to participation.

-   **Nimble**: We acted fast in rapidly changing environments. And we achieved meaningful and timely results.

-   **Human**: We respected every idea and everyone as worthy of consideration. We put in the time and built trust: Meeting people where they are. Making personal connections. Reviewing draft applications. Answering the phone.

-   **Fair**: We used a transparent process to grant funding based on merit. Known to many as the venerable “stoplight chart,” it helped us root decisions in consensus instead of allowing the loudest voice in the room to carry the day.

-   **Detailed**: To be honest, we were a little ridiculous. We sweated all the small stuff and put our hearts into everything—whether designing decisionmaking processes, planning events, writing reports, or just creating name tags.

-   **Open**: We documented our craft. Inspired by the open source community, we shared our “code” so that others could learn from our experiences.

## Advice

-   **Relieve anxiety.** No one likes being stressed out. Do you best to relieve the anxiety of those around you. Be relentlessly organized and help others tackle their most pressing challenges.

-   **Dig into the details.** Sweat the small stuff, whether you’re recruiting participants, designing an event agenda, or just making nametags. The quality of every experience hinges on your attention to detail.  

-   **Share openly.** Work for the public good. Document and share your work openly so that others can learn from our experience. Take inspiration from the open source community and consider how open sharing can promote more effective collaboration in sectors beyond technology.  

-   **Bring the bagels.** Hosting important conversations often isn’t glamorous work: Someone has to turn on the lights, set up the chairs, and, yes, even bring the bagels or beers, as the case may be.

-   **Listen intently.** Do your best to learn from the experts, including longtime community residents, city leaders, young people, academics, and practitioners. Be willing to challenge assumptions and continuously reflect on how you might improve your work.

-   **Take notes — then read them later.** We don’t know about you, but we are compulsive list-makers and note-takers. Read your notes, reflect on them, and share them with others so you can do better next time.

-   **Design for inclusion.** Put people first. Consider how human-centered design methods can be incorporated into your programs and activities to make them more accessible and equitable for all.

-   **Work together.** Host participatory events. Invite participants to co-design with you and help shape the future of your shared work. Truly, we are better together than we are apart.

-   **Think about what’s next.** Nothing happens in a vacuum, and context matters. Think about what participants might have experienced before and how they may have worked together in the past, and design accordingly. Then, make sure that each activity ends with a clear call to action and specific next steps.

## Vision of the Future

Much of what we set out to do is done. But, as we sunset, we know there is still more to do. Together, we must:

-   Understand that as one idea thrives, its success encourages others to rise.

-   Believe in the importance of deliberate dialogue and honest conversations.

-   Empower people to lead change. Creative solutions often originate from diverse perspectives coming together for a shared purpose.

-   Be responsive and agile. Transformation is more resilient when it comes from the top down *and* the bottom up.

-   Design with equity in mind. Tailor guidance and support for each audience.

-   Use separate criteria to evaluate the potential of untested ideas. And judge their impact using metrics that go beyond sustainability.

-   Build a deep network of support. Provide access to resources, mentorship, and opportunities for learning and growth.

-   Be curious and attentive. Dedicate time to reflection and documentation.

-   Share successes and failures with each other and with the world.

We are proud of our successes and mindful of the mistakes we made along the way. We trust those who trusted us—with their ideas, their money, their leadership, and their time—to learn from our work. And we humbly offer this advice for the future.

The Sprout Fund was driven by the desire to empower grassroots innovators by providing them with the resources and connections they needed to cultivate their ideas and create stronger communities. This Field Guide is a free and open resource that was written by Sprout to encourage people to invest in community-driven collaboration.

We sincerely hope that these ideas inspire you to create more open, connected, and generous communities. We encourage you to freely remix and reuse these ideas to the extent that they resonate with you and your local context.
