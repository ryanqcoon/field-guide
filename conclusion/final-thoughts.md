The Sprout Fund was driven by the desire to empower grassroots innovators by providing them with the resources and connections they needed to cultivate their ideas and create stronger communities. The Community Building Field Guide is a free and open resource that was written by Sprout to encourage people to invest in community-driven collaboration.

The Community Building Campaign Model described herein offers ideas about how to design and develop connected communities. The model might be new, but the ideas supporting its development were honed through more than a decade of community-based work, and they are built on a theoretical foundation thatâ€™s much older than that.

We sincerely hope that these ideas inspire you to create more open, connected, and generous communities. We encourage you to freely remix and reuse these ideas to the extent that they resonate with you and your local context.

Remember, at its core, community building is about creating the conditions for collaboration and facilitating connections between people. So long as you stay true to that mission, your work will surely continue to evolve and grow.
