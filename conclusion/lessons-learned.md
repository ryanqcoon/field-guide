**Relieve anxiety.** No one likes being stressed out. Do you best to relieve the anxiety of those around you. Be relentlessly organized and help others tackle their most pressing challenges.

**Dig into the details.** Sweat the small stuff, whether you’re recruiting participants, designing an event agenda, or just making nametags. The quality of every experience hinges on your attention to detail.  

**Share openly.** Work for the public good. Document and share your work openly so that others can learn from our experience. Take inspiration from the open source community and consider how open sharing can promote more effective collaboration in sectors beyond technology.  

**Bring the bagels.** Hosting important conversations often isn’t glamorous work: Someone has to turn on the lights, set up the chairs, and, yes, even bring the bagels or beers, as the case may be.

**Listen intently.** Do your best to learn from the experts, including longtime community residents, city leaders, young people, academics, and practitioners. Be willing to challenge assumptions and continuously reflect on how you might improve your work.

**Take notes — then read them later.** We don’t know about you, but we are compulsive list-makers and note-takers. Read your notes, reflect on them, and share them with others so you can do better next time.

**Design for inclusion.** Put people first. Consider how human-centered design methods can be incorporated into your programs and activities to make them more accessible and equitable for all.

**Work together.** Host participatory events. Invite participants to co-design with you and help shape the future of your shared work. Truly, we are better together than we are apart.

**Think about what’s next.** Nothing happens in a vacuum, and context matters. Think about what participants might have experienced before and how they may have worked together in the past, and design accordingly. Then, make sure that each activity ends with a clear call to action and specific next steps.
