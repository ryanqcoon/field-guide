## Overview

Building a library of comprehensive multimedia documentation assets helps to tell the story of the funding program. This often includes contracting services to document and promote while also creating new content that tells the story of how the individual projects come together to make a larger impact for the community.

Projects can be documented through a mixture of written stories, images, audio, and videos. By documenting project activities, the efforts of the community are recorded, catalogued, and promoted via multimedia means and in a way that can be easily shared publicly. This serves not only to archive community activity, but also to spotlight people, projects, ideas, and collaborations in a way that connects them to the broader initiative.

By supporting and documenting catalytic funding project activities, you help write a lasting story detailing the process by which emerging leaders are seeding community change, energizing civic and cultural life, and catalyzing local solutions in a high quality way that helps to expand the reach of the program. The project documentation can be shared with the projects to use on their websites and marketing materials. It is also helpful in creating more dynamic showcase events to highlight outstanding projects and community activities or to seek editorial coverage to market the work of the larger program.
