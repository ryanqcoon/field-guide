## Overview

Reports are used to stay up-to-date on project activities as well as approve additional grant disbursements. Similar to application design step of the process, it is important to consider what information is needed and how the grantee can best communicate that information in a useful way. The questions and prompts should align with the funding given, both in regard to content matter and amount of information being asked.

A great starting place when creating a report template is the application and/or project plan. This ensures that project managers are reporting on the materials used to authorize the grant and the outcome measure that were developed specifically for the project. It is also important to require a budget-to-actual financial update to ensure that funds are being used as planned, and if they are not, that they are still being used in a way that appropriate for the funding program before additional disbursements are made or the grant is formally closed.  

While information about reporting requirements should be included in the grant agreement, it is important to send a reminder with the report template 2-4 weeks prior to the report due date. Subsequent reminders should be sent once the due date has passed until the report has been received.

If an extension for the grant is requested, the report can then be used as justification for the extension, and should include updated information on activities and funds spent to-date along with an updated timeline of outstanding project activities. This report can then be considered an interim report, with an additional report then being required when all of the project activities have been completed and the funds spent down.

### Thinking Questions

* What information is needed to close the grant or provide the next funding disbursement?
* Did the grantee provide custom outcome goals and measurements that were incorporated into the grant agreement?
* What information would be helpful to compare or report on across grants from the same funding program?
* If given permission by the grantee, would you like to make some of the report information public to help share the story of the project and/or overarching funding program?
* Would you be willing to meet with grantees, set up phone calls, or a small event for verbal reporting?
