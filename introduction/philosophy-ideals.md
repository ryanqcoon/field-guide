The Sprout Fund pioneered a new mechanism for community-driven, community-advised
philanthropy. Working out of neighborhood storefronts, we were open and
accessible to anyone with an idea. Our investments amplified diverse voices and
created space in Pittsburgh for new approaches. We built strong networks to help
ideas take hold. From 2001 to 2018, we showed that small-scale catalytic
projects can yield big results.

Our approach to community change was born of its time and place but, over 17
years, it evolved. It was durable, flexible, and adaptable because a distinct
set of beliefs guided our work:

-   **Responsive**: We amplified community voices and listened to local needs.

-   **Inclusive**: We welcomed diverse perspectives. We opened doors for new
    audiences by reducing barriers to participation.

-   **Nimble**: We acted fast in rapidly changing environments. And we achieved
    meaningful and timely results.

-   **Human**: We respected every idea and everyone as worthy of consideration.
    We put in the time and built trust: Meeting people where they are. Making
    personal connections. Reviewing draft applications. Answering the phone.

-   **Fair**: We used a transparent process to grant funding based on merit.
    Known to many as the venerable “stoplight chart,” it helped us root
    decisions in consensus instead of allowing the loudest voice in the room to
    carry the day.

-   **Detailed**: To be honest, we were a little ridiculous. We sweated all the
    small stuff and put our hearts into everything—whether designing
    decisionmaking processes, planning events, writing reports, or just creating
    name tags.

-   **Open**: We documented our craft. Inspired by the open source community, we
    shared our “code” so that others could learn from our experiences.


Many friends and supporters championed our efforts. We worked as an
intermediary between the grassroots and treetops. We helped new leaders engage
in their communities. Our founders led with a compelling vision. We were
governed by a board dedicated to this community. And through long service
together, our staff of nonprofit professionals became a family. Collectively we
charted a mighty course.

Much of what we set out to do is done. But, as we sunset, we know there is still more to do.
Together, we must:

-   Understand that as one idea thrives, its success encourages others to rise.

-   Believe in the importance of deliberate dialogue and honest conversations.

-   Empower people to lead change. Creative solutions often originate from
    diverse perspectives coming together for a shared purpose.

-   Be responsive and agile. Transformation is more resilient when it comes from
    the top down *and* the bottom up.

-   Design with equity in mind. Tailor guidance and support for each audience.

-   Use separate criteria to evaluate the potential of untested ideas. And judge
    their impact using metrics that go beyond sustainability.

-   Build a deep network of support. Provide access to resources, mentorship,
    and opportunities for learning and growth.

-   Be curious and attentive. Dedicate time to reflection and documentation.

-   Share successes and failures with each other and with the world.

We are proud of our successes and mindful of the mistakes we made along the way.
We trust those who trusted us—with their ideas, their money, their leadership,
and their time—to learn from our work. And we humbly offer this advice for the
future.
