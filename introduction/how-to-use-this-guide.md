## How To Use This Guide

Over Sprout's two decades, weâ€™ve been lucky to work with grantmakers, governments, nonprofits, schools, startups, community organizers, and more. The common thread among these many "friends of Sprout" has been **their commitment to catalyzing change in their communities.** 

We wrote this guide to "open source" Sprout's approach to catalytic funding, community building, and storytelling. If you count yourself as someone who endeavors to create more inclusive and vibrant communities, then you might be attracted to the ideas within this publication. 

We encourage you to read our reflections, fork this guide, remix Sprout's approach, and apply these ideas within your own context. Feel free to draw on ideas that resonate with you and focus on the sections that feel most relevant to your work. You can read the publication straight through, jump to your favorite section, or search for key terms. However you use it, we hope you'll be inspired to catalyze positive change and cultivate connected communities.
