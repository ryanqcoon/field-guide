# Sprout Field Guide for Philanthropy & Civic Action
Ideas and resources to seed innovation, make community-advised decisions, host participatory events, communicate effectively, and catalyze local change. Created by [The Sprout Fund](https://www.sproutfund.org/).

## MGH To Do

* edit links in Tracker to fieldguide.sproutfund.org
* migrate TOC descriptions
* copy/paste overviews for missing CatFun sections
* hide funder reporting (for now)


## DEC To Do

* review [templates/downloads](http://fieldguide.sproutfund.org/resources/templates-downloads/) & [external links](http://fieldguide.sproutfund.org/resources/related-external-links/) to verify we've got everything there we want
* review the original google docs and see if anything didn't migrate
